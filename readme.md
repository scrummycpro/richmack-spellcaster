# Flask Translation and Notes App

This is a Flask application that provides translation services and a notes feature. The application can translate English text to Hebrew and allows users to save and view notes with optional image uploads. The application is dockerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Features

- Translate English text to Hebrew
- Save translations to an SQLite database
- Add notes with optional image uploads
- Save notes to an SQLite database
- Search translations
- Export search results and recent translations to CSV

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional, for simplified management)

## Setup and Run

### Using Docker

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Create `requirements.txt`:**

   ```bash
   echo -e "Flask==2.1.2\ntransformers==4.30.2\ntorch==2.0.1\nWerkzeug==2.1.2\nsentencepiece" > requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create `Dockerfile`:**

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF > Dockerfile
   # Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
   FROM python:3.8

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
   COPY requirements.txt /app/

   # Install the dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy the rest of the application code into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Set environment variables
   ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
   ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

   # Expose port 5000 to the outside world
   EXPOSE 5000

   # Run the Flask application
   CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=5000"]
   EOF
   ```

4. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-app-hebrew .
   ```

5. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5003:5000 --name my-flask-app -v "$(pwd)":/app flask-app-hebrew
   ```

6. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5003`.

### Using Docker Compose

1. **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     flask-app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5003:5000"
       volumes:
         - .:/app
   ```

2. **Build and run the application with Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5003`.

### Running Locally

If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
